This program takes commands from the network, and forwards them to a Lego NXT connected via Bluetooth or USB to the computer.  It is designed for use with the iPhone application iNXT Remote, available on the iTunes Application Store.

This will be updated over time to add features and functionality that are not needed for the basic job of forwarding packets to the NXT.
